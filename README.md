# PyYelp

**This program helps the user to find the restaurants, dentists, bars, salons, or doctors they are looking for. This program uses Yelp's API to fetch the stores' information.**
1. The program will ask the user what store they is looking for.
2. The program will ask the user that they want to look for the store near which location.
3. The program will ask the user about rating which helps they to filter out stores that lower than their desired rating.
